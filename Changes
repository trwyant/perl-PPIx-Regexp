  Accept non-ASCII whitespace under /x. The Whitespace object can be
    multiple characters; the perl_version_introduced() becomes
    '5.021001' if any of them is a code point above 127.
  The perl_version_removed() method now returns '5.021001' when called
    on a PPIx::Regexp object produced by parsing '?foo?' (match once
    without explicit 'm'). The object produced by parsing 'm?foo?' still
    returns the minimum Perl version.

  Do not parse unadorned parentheses as capture groups when /n is in
    effect. Instead, they are parsed as PPIx::Regexp::Structure. Named
    captures appear to be unaffected by /n.
  Made a verbose dump a little more so. Specifically, dump
    max_capture_group where relevant, and display dumped values a bit
    more informatively.

  Recognize nested subscripts in interpolation.
    Thanks to Andy Lester for finding this, which actually manifested in
    Perl-Critic-Policy-Variables-ProhibitUnusedVarsStricter. The problem is
    that the actual heuristics for finding the end of an interpolation are
    undocumented, and I missed this rather-obvious case.

  Make \b{foo} into an unknown token (and therefore an error. This
    applies to \b{anything}, where 'anything' is anything bur 'gcb',
    'wb', or 'sb'.

  Handle the boundary assertions introduced in Perl 5.21.9: '\b{gcb}'
    (grapheme cluster boundary), '\b{wb}' (word boundary), '\b{sb}'
    (sentence boundary), and the corresponding '\B{...}' constructions.
    Similar-looking things like '\b{foo}' are not recognized as
    assertions, and end up being literals.  This is less general than I
    usually make things, but was done against the possibility that
    (e.g.) '\b{foo}' might be introduced later, requiring
    perl_version_released() to return a different number. Any of these
    retracted prior to Perl 5.22.0 will simply be removed from
    PPIx::Regexp.

0.037		2014-11-12	T. R. Wyant

  Correctly mark the replacement portion of s///ee as code. Prior to

  Make available the number of times a given modifier is asserted

  Retract the "Allow non-ASCII white space under /x" change introduced

  Properly handle multi-character modifiers like /ee. We now handle /eie
    as being the same as /eei. Thanks to Anonymous Monk for finding
    this.
  Properly handle \g and \k back references that do not correspond to an
    actual capture group. They are now reblessed into the unknown token,
    and counted as errors. Thanks to Anonymous Monk for finding this.
  Add method error() to PPIx::Regexp::Element. This should return an
    error message when the element is in error -- normally when it has
    been blessed into the unknown token or structure.
  Add method modifier_asserted() to PPIx::Regexp::Element. This walks
    the parse tree backward to determine if the given modifier is in
    effect for the element.

  Add Regex Sets, which were added to Perl as an experimental feature in

    change.
  Ditch PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType method __expect_after_match() in
    favor of the more general __match_setup(). This is done without

  Add the /a modifier to PPI::Regexp::Token::Modifiers, legal only in
    the (?:...) construction. This was introduced in Perl 5.13.9.
  When parsing an interpolation from a replacement string (rather than a
    regular expression), take subscripts at face value rather than
    trying to disambiguate them from quantifiers and character classes,
    which they can't be in this context.

0.016		2011-01-05	T. R. Wyant
  The PPIx::Regexp::Token::Code perl_version_introduced() method now

  Documented intent to revoke support for features introduced in a
    development Perl which do not make it to a production release. This
    is necessary because in this case the syntax could be reused with
    different semantics.
  Added support for Perl 5.13.6 (?^...) construction.
  Added support for Perl 5.13.6 d, l, and u modifiers.
  Fixed inconsistency in perl_version_introduced() results between
    PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier and

  Recognize \o{...} as a PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal, with
    perl_version_introduced() of 5.0013003.
  Terminate \0.. through \7.. after three characters, as Perl does.
    These two were brought to my attention by Brian D.  Foy's "The
    Effective Perler" for October 11 2010,
    http://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com/blog/697
  Correct the PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal ordinal() method for '\b'. As
    a literal, this is a back space.

0.013		2010-10-10	T. R. Wyant
  Declare a parse failure if characters are found between the '}' and
    the ')' of (?{...}) and (??{...}), and rebless the tokens to
    ::Unknown. Perl does not accept anything here, so I think I should
    not either.
  Whitespace tweak in the PPIx::Regexp::Dumper test output for the
    failures test.
  Replace the PPI logic in PPIx::Regexp::Token::Code with a call to
    $tokenizer->find_matching_delimiter(). This is actually the way Perl
    works, as a look at toke.c and regcomp.c makes clear.
  Push the perl_version_introduced() back to 5.0 at the request of
    Alexandr Ciornii, for the potential benefit of Perl::MinimumVersion.
    This was done mostly by reading the various perlre, perldelta, and
    perlop documents, so these should be taken with a HUGE grain of
    salt.

  Remove dependencies on Params::Util and Readonly. The latter was
    requested by ADAMK for the benefit of Padre. It involved changing
    the symbols exported from PPIx::Regexp::Constant, but these were
    documented as private, so ...
  Parse POSIX character classes [=a=] and [.a.] as
    PPIx::Regexp::Token::CharClass::POSIX::Unknown, which counts as a
    parse failure since these are not supported by Perl.
  Make the PPI::Document created by PPIx::Regexp::Token::Code->ppi() be
    read only. This means we need PPI 1.116. Cache the document, and
    ensure the cached result is returned on subsequent calls.

  Promote methods can_be_quantified() and is_quantifier() from

    them. They still return true and false respectively.
  Override can_be_quantified() to return false on PPIx::Regexp,

  Override is_quantifier() to return true on

  Modify PPIx::Regexp::Dumper to be able to display can_be_quantified

  Fixed RT 56864 - PPIx::Regexp::Lexer fails in Perl::Critic under Perl
    5.13.0. This was due to the value of a returned $+[0] getting
    transmogrified before the caller saw it. I never did isolate what
    triggered the bug.

  Parse \N{...} in accordance with perl5115delta. The curlys must
    contain an alpha followed by alphanumerics, spaces, parens, colons,
    or dashes. \N{ without a matching } is a character class (if legal)
    followed by a literal '{'.
  Parse \N inside a character class as PPI::Regexp::Token::Unknown,
    since Perl 5.11.5 considers this a compile error. A \N{...} inside a
    character class is still OK.
  Add method match() to PPIx::Regexp::Tokenizer. This is analogous to
    capture(), but returns the entire matched string.

0.005		2009-12-26	T. R. Wyant
  Recognize \N (without curlys), back-ported from Perl 6 into 5.11.
  Recognize unicode characters as \N{[[:alpha:]] ... rather than
    \N{[\w\s:] ... This is per the 5.11 documentation, but I think Perl
    always worked this way.
  Recognize loose matching of Unicode character classes, and allow '='
    in lieu of a single ':' in a Unicode character class (this from Perl
    5.11.3).
  PPIx::Regexp::Dumper now produces the proper output when called with
